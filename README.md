Classification-on-Multiple-Disease

Overview

This project uses machine learning to predict diabetes risk based on health-related features like BMI, heart disease, smoking, and physical activity. 
It aims to enable early detection for better disease management.

Dataset
The dataset includes features such as:

Heart Disease: History of heart conditions.

BMI: Body Mass Index, linked to obesity.

Smoking: Impacts insulin sensitivity.

Alcohol Drinking: Affects liver and insulin resistance.

Stroke: Indicates related health risks.

Physical/Mental Health: Influences blood sugar regulation.

Physical Activity: Affects obesity and insulin resistance.

General Health: Overall health status.

Sleep Time: Linked to insulin resistance.

Approach

Preprocessing: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, scale numerical features.

Class Imbalance: Use SMOTE or class weighting to balance classes.

Models: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, SVM, KNN, Naive Bayes, Neural Networks, XGBoost.

Evaluation: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.

Tuning: Optimize hyperparameters for better performance.

Goal
Develop a model to accurately predict diabetes risk, aiding healthcare professionals in early intervention.
